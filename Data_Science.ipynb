    "# Visualizing Housing Market Data\n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes information on median housing prices and sales volume for different housing markets. Here's a brief overview of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Housing Markets**: A list of market names denoted by 'Market A' to 'Market E'.\n",
    "- **Median Housing Prices**: Median housing prices (in dollars) for each market.\n",
    "- **Housing Sales Volume**: Sales volume for each market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median Housing Prices\n",
